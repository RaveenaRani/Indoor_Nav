The research undertaken involved determining the accuracy of locating a subject indoors using WiFi signal strength indications on smartphones and Raspberry Pi systems, as opposed to GPS which produces unreliable and inaccurate results within a small space and does not provide ‘vertical’ information such as which floor you are on. 

This indoor localisation will then have implications for developing an indoor navigation system which will be further developed into an application that can be used on a smart device.

Part of this work required performing a series of simple experiments with volunteers to determine how well location can be inferred from joint coding of the WiFi channel strength sensing.  This involved moving along corridors of the RSM and the Imperial Incubator, collecting positional information where possible.
 
This concept borrows from the idea of biological place cells: computational units in the brain which provides an internal representation of where a person/animal is. This system has a wide range of applications, most notably in helping people with serious visual impairment to safely navigate through a possibly difficult arrangement.
